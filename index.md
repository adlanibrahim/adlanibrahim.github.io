Hi there, and welcome to my personal website. I'm a mechanical engineer, I got my degree from the University of Khartoum, worked in several companies, see CV.

One of many reasons to build my own website is to use it as a repository for my own thoughts and ideas regarding different topics. I love science, especially physics, so I guess I'll do that too. Besides, I have a couple of ideas that I wanted to pursue and see how they will develop into something applicable, you can see upcoming Projects for further info.

This very website was an idea in my head for quite some time. So I guess I'm getting my hands dirty by initiating myself into doing something about it.. that being said, this website is an ongoing project where I'll be toying with it until I find a satisfying version.
