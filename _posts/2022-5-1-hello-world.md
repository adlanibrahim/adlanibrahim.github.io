## My first step

This is one of my first attempts to try to build a personal website, you can only imagine how excited I was. After long overdue I finally decided to just do it, approaching such task can be a very daunting and time consuming, which stems not from the rarity of resources, but from the overwhelming information the internet can offer. 

## The criteria 

Choosing the right platform is obviously the first step. Two things that I have kept in mind while googling, one of them is the ease of use, I wanted to have a template that can easily be customized, plus posting on the go. The other thing is I wanted the thing to be free of charge. Obviously, paid platforms usually come with their benefits. However this option is not accessible to me right now.

## The platform 

Github is well known in tech world, I often used it to download codes from its repository so I'm a little familiar with its layout. I didn't know until lately that you can actually build a website using github pages.
