## My first step

This is one of my first attempts in trying to build a personal website, you can only imagine how excited I was. After long overdue I finally decided to just do it, approaching such task can be very daunting and time consuming, which stems not from the rarity of resources, but from the overwhelming information the internet can offer. 

## The criteria 

Choosing the right platform is obviously the first step. Two things that I have kept in my mind while googling, one of them is the ease of use, I wanted to have a template that can easily be customized, plus posting on the go. The other thing is I wanted the thing to be free of charge. Obviously, paid platforms usually come with their benefits. However this option is not accessible to me right now.

## The platform 

Github is well known in tech world, I often used it to download codes from its repository so I'm a little familiar with its layout. I didn't know until lately that you can actually build a website using the so called [github pages](https://pages.github.com), plus posting and editing using Jekyll (see Posts). A first look at github website would frighten non-technical guys like myself, it just needs time to be familiar with. Having patience is the secret ingredient to the whole thing, googling technical questions is of course a vital skill to learn, like how to add my CV to my website, and how to post (embed) a video or a pic on my blog. These kind of questions I will try to address in my blog while experimenting with different answers to find the best version for the website.

## The video 

Here is a great video that encouraged me to get my hands dirty, it is a good intro for the beginners. I followed its clear steps to the latter. Thanks to [kathryn schuler](https://kathrynschuler.com/) and her guidance I present my first version. So I recommend this video for you, specially if you have never done a website before, just like me.
